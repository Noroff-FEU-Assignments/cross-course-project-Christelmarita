    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        I would inform my client that there are several ways in which their website could be attacked and that proper measures should be considered as protection. 
        I would advise them to use a solution like NodeJS  for sanitizing the HTML code and to ensure that the system accepts data in the right format. I would also recommend the use of Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD) to catch any oversights from developers and maintain the reliability of the changes that a coming to a codebase.
        
        I would, if applicable, advice them to use an open-standard authorization protocol or framework to make sure that authorization and authentication would be hard to crack. I would also inform them that they could use a third party application, but that it should be a tried and tested one. They should opt for an application that is widely known and used. 
        
        Lastly I would tell them that if they were to choose the hosting platform, they should be sure to pick a reliable one as data could be compromised via the hosting platform.</p>
